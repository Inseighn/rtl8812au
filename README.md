## Realtek 802.11ac (rtl88xxau)

This driver is from the Kali Linux Repos!
I have been having trouble getting the 8812au drivers to work with my
AWUS036ACH card. The drivers released in Kali 2017.1 were the only ones that worked with packet injection and had a stable monitor mode. I did not see a github repo for the driver anywhere else so I created one. 

This is working for me on Fedora 25 Kernel Version 4.11.6

I will try to keep this repo up to date with the updates from kali.
